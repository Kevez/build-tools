# Build Tools
A set of useful build tools for client-side applications.

All tools are built using Gulp.

# Project purpose
It's common to see Gulpfiles which are hundreds of lines long and it's sometimes hard to see what's going on.

This project aims to split out each task into its own file. As a result, everything is cleaner and more readable.
